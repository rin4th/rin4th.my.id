# About this Book
Welcome to my personal Golang Documentation!
I have created this book as proof of everything I have learned while studying this language. The reason for this is that whenever I learn Golang, I often to revisit the course videos I watched in the past, but this takes time. Therefore, I decided to remake the Golang documentation in a way that best suits my learning style. This way, I can understand it later, without having to rewatch the videos.

# NOTE
All of the content is based on my lerning from various paid and free sources. I have sought permission to quote and take inspiration from the owners of the copyright, especially from the creators of paid courses.

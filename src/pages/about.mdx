# About me
Harro! I'm Rizal Nur, a student at University in Indonesia. Sometimes, I write code for my small projects, focusing on software engineering and cyber security. In the future, I want to mainly focus on cyber security. I speak Bahasa, English, and little bit of Japanese. Though I am currently still learning English, feel free to correct both the content and language of my content whenever needed.

# About this blog
Writing is a method to learn and understand what you have learned, which is why I made this blog to help myself understand more what I have learned and help train me on learning writing in English. Furthermore, I hope that the content in this blog can help people who are facing the same problems.

# How i made this blog
I used Astro and Svelte with a template from [Elianiva](https://github.com/elianiva/elianiva.my.id) to build this blog. Since this is the case, I only needed to change the UI and add a **Books** page as a form of documentation to list all the things I have learned.
